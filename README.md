Tactiil for Pebble
==================

This is a simple app that vibrates the minutes of the time in binary when you shake your wrist.

It needs to be the background app, and opening the app toggles whether it's enabled or not to avoid spurious vibrations when you don't want it.

I use it when I'm walking outside in winter and can check the time without having to take my hands out of my gloves/pockets.

Dream
=====

The dream is to have a "menu" by rotating your wrist after the initial shake for simple things like playing/pausing music, or maybe vibrating incoming messages in morse code.  But for now, the clock side of things works well.
